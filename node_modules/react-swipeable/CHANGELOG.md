# 4.3.0
* Add `rotationAngle` prop. [#103](https://github.com/dogfessional/react-swipeable/pull/103)
  * will allow to set a rotation angle, e.g. for a four-player game on a tablet, where each player has a 90Â° turned view.
  * Thank you [@Narquadah](https://github.com/Narquadah) and [@LarsKumbier](https://github.com/LarsKumbier)!

# 4.2.2

# 4.2.0
* Add support for calling `preventDefault` on Chrome 56+ via passive event support checking and manual event listener setup. [#88](https://github.com/dogfessional/react-swipeable/pull/88)
  * Thank you [@kl0tl](https://github.com/kl0tl) and [@KrashStudio](https://github.com/KrashStudio)!

# 4.0.1
* fixed bug where delta was causing a swipe to not be tracked correctly, #74 , thanks @mctep

# 4.0.0

* **Major Change** `preventDefaultTouchmoveEvent` defaults to `false` now [#69](https://github.com/dogfessional/react-swipeable/issue/69)
  * This change is in part due to a [Chrome56+ change](https://github.com/dogfessional/react-swipeable#chrome-56-and-later-warning-with-preventdefault)
* **Major Change** drop support for React 12 & 13, `peerDependencies` updated [#64](https://github.com/dogfessional/react-swipeable/pull/64)
  * `prop-types` added to `dependencies` [#64](https://github.com/dogfessional/react-swipeable/pull/64)
* **Major Change** `trackMouse` now 'tracks' the swipe outside of the swipeable component, [#67](https://github.com/dogfessional/react-swipeable/pull/67).
  * Thanks for example [@TanaseHagi](https://github.com/TanaseHagi)
* react 16 added to `peerDependencies`

# 3.9.0

* add `onTap` functionality. Thanks [@anicke](https://github.com/anicke) . [#61](https://github.com/dogfessional/react-swipeable/pull/61) [#39](https://github.com/dogfessional/react-swipeable/issues/39)
* added persisting synthetic event in example via `e.persist()`. This should help people see more details in the console when debugging in the [example](http://dogfessional.github.io/react-swipeable/).

# 3.8.0

* Allow `onMouseDown`, `onMouseUp`, and `onMouseMove` props to fire appropriately again. [#55](https://github.com/dogfessional/react-swipeable/pull/55), thanks [@lochstar](https://github.com/lochstar)
* Stop using this.state to track swipes, thanks [@grantila](https://github.com/grantila) for pointing out this change and submitting PR, [#58](https://github.com/dogfessional/react-swipeable/pull/58). Should provide minor performance gains since `Swipeable` will no longer be calling `this.setState` internally.

# 3.7.0

* add ability to track mouse events as touch events. Thanks [@jakepusateri](https://github.com/jakepusateri) and [@Marcel-G](https://github.com/Marcel-G). [#51](https://github.com/dogfessional/react-swipeable/issues/51)
